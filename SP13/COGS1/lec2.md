Dr. Coulson works in language comprehension and gender comprehension.  Her lab
required that you be a fluent English speaker.  Left handers excluded.

Undergraduate degree from Wellsley College.  Planned to major in Biology and go
to medical school.  Due to an 8am class, change to Cognitive Science.

# Human Brain

- An extension of the spinal cord
- Brain in the controller of the body, coordinates all actions that make us
  "human"

## Cerebreal Hemispheres

- Similar, but not identical
- Differ in function

## Corpus Callosum

- Connects the two hemispheres

## Cerebral Lobes

- Brain divided into 4 lobes
- Frontal Lobe (Everything forward of central sulcus)
- Parietal Lobe (Everything rear of the central sulcus)
- Temporal Lobe
- Occipital Lobe

## Nuerons

- Brain composed of neurons
  - About 100 billion
- Neurons both send and receive signals to other cells in pulses
- Important Parts
  - Cell body
  - Axon Hillock
  - Axon
  - Synapse

## Connectivity

- Each nueron connected to 10,000 other neurons
- Point of contact is the synapse
- Computing power of the brain comes from these connections

## Cortex

- Two millimeters thick and has area of 1.5 square meters
- Hill = "Gyrus"
- Valley = "Sulcus"

## Cartoon View: Frontal Lobe

- In front of central sulcus
- Motor control
- Decisions, judgments, emotions
- Language production

## Cartoon View: Parietal Lobe

- Behind the central sulcus
- Perception of stimuli related to touch, pressure, temperature, and pain
- Attention
- Spatial Cognition

## Cartoon View: Temporal Lobe

- Below the lateral fissure
- High level vision
- Object recognition
- Auditory processing

## Cartoon View: Occipital Lobe

- Located at the back of the brain, behind the parietal lobe and temporal lobe
- Vision

# Lateralization of Function

One side of the brain is more important for some given function.

Typically a matter of degree.  This corresponds to strongly *vs* weakly
lateralized

Motor control is a good example of a lateralized function

Most data we have on lateralization comes from stroke victims

## Motor Control

Hemisphere crossover to control opposite side of body (Contra-lateral)

## Sensorimotor Cortex

Area near central sulcus which maps motor control onto areas of the brain.
Also responsible for somatosensory info.

## Language

- *Aphasia* - Partial or total loss of ability to articulate ideas due to brain
  damage
- Broca's Area - Lower side of left frontal lobe

## Brodmann's Areas

- Korbinian Brodmann examined brain cells with various stains designed to
  detect chemical difference between areas
- Brain ares defined by cytoarchitectonic characteristics.

## Wernicke's Aphasia

- 1871 Karl Wernicke reported a different sort of language disorder
- Symptoms
  - Talk fluently, excessively
  - Use made up words

## Sex Differences

- Women more vulnerable to aphasia after damage to frontal lobe
- Men more vulnerable to aphasia after damage to parietal and temporal lobe
  areas
- Similar sex differences in *apraxia*, impairment in voluntary motions
